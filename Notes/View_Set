Django REST Framework Views Series:

APIViews
Generic Views
ViewSets
==========================================
3. ViewSets  : https://testdriven.io/blog/drf-views-part-3/

ViewSet is a type of class-based view.
Instead of method handlers, like .get() and .post(), it provides actions, like .list() and .create().
The most significant advantage of ViewSets is that the URL construction is handled automatically (with a router class).
This helps with the consistency of the URL conventions across your API and minimizes the amount of code you need to write.
There are four types of ViewSets, from the most basic to the most powerful:

ViewSet
GenericViewSet
ReadOnlyModelViewSet
ModelViewSet

Actions :
The following actions are handled by the router class by default:

list
create
retrieve (pk needed)
update (pk needed)
partial_update (pk needed)
destroy (pk needed)

Handling URLs :
Although you could map the URLs of your ViewSets the same way as you would with other views, this is not the point of ViewSets.
Instead of using Django's urlpatterns, ViewSets come with a router class that automatically generates the URL configurations.
DRF comes with two routers out-of-the-box:

SimpleRouter
DefaultRouter
